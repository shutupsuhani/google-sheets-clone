#Google Sheets Clone
-
Overview
This project aims to develop a web-based spreadsheet application that closely resembles Google Sheets in terms of UI, functionality, and user interactions. The application provides a spreadsheet-like interface with support for mathematical operations, data validation, formula execution, and essential UI interactions such as drag-and-drop functionality and cell dependencies.

Key Features
1. Spreadsheet Interface
✅ Google Sheets-Like UI: Intuitive design with a toolbar, formula bar, and structured cells.
✅ Cell Dependencies: Formulas update dynamically when referenced cells change.

2. Mathematical Functions
Supports essential spreadsheet calculations, including:

SUM: Computes the total of a selected range.
AVERAGE: Calculates the mean value of a range.
MAX / MIN: Finds the highest and lowest values in a given range.
COUNT: Determines the number of numerical values in a range.
3. Data Quality Functions
Enhances data accuracy and organization through:

TRIM: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from text.
UPPER / LOWER: Converts text to uppercase or lowercase.
REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Eliminates duplicate rows from a selected range.
FIND_AND_REPLACE: Allows users to search for and replace specific text within a range.
4. Data Entry & Validation
✅ Supports multiple data types (numbers, text, dates).
✅ Built-in validation to ensure numeric cells only contain valid numerical values.

5. Real-Time Testing & Execution
✅ Users can test functions with their own data.
✅ Function results are displayed dynamically within the interface.
