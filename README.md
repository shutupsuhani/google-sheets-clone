Google Sheets Clone
-

Overview
-
This project aims to develop a web application that closely mimics the user interface and core functionalities of Google Sheets. The application provides a spreadsheet-like interface with support for mathematical functions, data entry, validation, and essential UI interactions such as drag-and-drop functionality and cell dependencies.

Features
-
1. Spreadsheet Interface

-Mimic Google Sheets UI: The design closely resembles Google Sheets, including the toolbar, formula bar, and cell structure.

-Drag Functions: Users can drag cell content, formulas, and selections similar to Google Sheets.

-Cell Dependencies: Formulas update dynamically when referenced cells change.

-Basic Cell Formatting: Supports bold, italics, font size, and color changes.

-Row & Column Management: Users can add, delete, and resize rows and columns.

2. Mathematical Functions

The following mathematical functions are implemented:

SUM: Calculates the sum of a range of cells.

AVERAGE: Computes the average value of a range.

MAX: Finds the maximum value in a range.

MIN: Finds the minimum value in a range.

COUNT: Counts the number of numerical values in a range.

3. Data Quality Functions

The following functions enhance data quality:

TRIM: Removes leading and trailing whitespace.

UPPER: Converts text to uppercase.

LOWER: Converts text to lowercase.

REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Eliminates duplicate rows in a selected range.

FIND_AND_REPLACE: Searches and replaces text in a specified range.

4. Data Entry & Validation

Supports various data types: numbers, text, dates.

Implements validation to ensure numeric cells only contain numbers.

5. Testing

Users can test functions with their own data.

Function execution results are displayed clearly.

Bonus Features (if implemented)

Additional mathematical and data quality functions.

Support for complex formulas and cell referencing (relative and absolute references).

Save and load functionality for spreadsheets.

Data visualization features such as charts and graphs.

Evaluation Criteria

UI Fidelity: How closely the interface and interactions match Google Sheets.

Functionality: Completeness and correctness of implemented features.

Accuracy: Ensuring calculations and data quality functions work correctly.

Usability: Intuitiveness and ease of use.

Code Quality: Maintainability and best coding practices.

Bonus Features: Extra functionalities implemented.
